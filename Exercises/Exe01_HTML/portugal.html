            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>Portugal, located on the Iberian Peninsula in Southern Europe, is a country known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and stunning landscapes. It is bordered by Spain to the east and north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south, giving it a long coastline that has influenced its maritime heritage. Portugal's capital, Lisbon, is a city renowned for its hilly, picturesque streets, historic neighborhoods like Alfama, and iconic landmarks such as the Belém Tower and Jerónimos Monastery. The country is also famous for its traditional Fado music, delicious cuisine featuring dishes like bacalhau (salted cod) and pastel de nata (custard tart), and its production of port wine, primarily from the Douro Valley region.

                Historically, Portugal was a major player during the Age of Discoveries in the 15th and 16th centuries, establishing a vast empire that included territories in Africa, Asia, and South America. This era left a lasting impact on Portuguese culture, evident in its architecture, language, and global connections. Today, Portugal is a member of the European Union and the United Nations, and it enjoys a high standard of living with a strong emphasis on sustainability and renewable energy. The country is also a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors with its beautiful beaches, historic sites, and warm Mediterranean climate.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Portugal's history is deeply intertwined with its maritime legacy and its role as a pioneer during the Age of Discoveries. The country traces its origins to the early medieval period, when it emerged as a distinct entity following the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors. In 1139, Afonso Henriques declared himself the first King of Portugal, and by 1179, the kingdom was recognized by the Pope. The 15th and 16th centuries marked the height of Portugal's global influence, as explorers like Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan embarked on voyages that established sea routes to India, Africa, and South America. This era of exploration led to the establishment of a vast Portuguese Empire, with colonies in Brazil, Africa, and Asia, significantly impacting global trade and cultural exchanges.

                The decline of Portugal's imperial power began in the late 16th century, exacerbated by the 1580-1640 Iberian Union with Spain and the subsequent loss of many overseas territories. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, one of the deadliest in history, further challenged the nation, leading to significant rebuilding efforts under the leadership of the Marquis of Pombal. In the 19th century, Portugal faced political instability, including the loss of Brazil, its largest colony, in 1822. The early 20th century saw the fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the Portuguese Republic in 1910. After decades of political turmoil and dictatorship under the Estado Novo regime, the peaceful Carnation Revolution in 1974 restored democracy. Portugal joined the European Union in 1986, which has since played a crucial role in its economic development and modernization, helping to transform it into a vibrant and dynamic nation.</p>
